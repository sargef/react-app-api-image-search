<h2><b><p align="center">Image Search via Flickr</p></b></h2>

<p align="center">The react api image search will require the following before running the app;</p>

1. __Sign up with flickr and apply for a non-commercial api key https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply__.
2. __Provide a config.js file in the root of your project, within this file add your api key like so;__.

*const apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';*
*export default apiKey;*

3. __Add a .gitignore file to your app and make sure it includes the config.js file so that others cannot view your key details__.
4. __Run npm install in the root of the project__.
5. __npm start.__
6. __View on localhost port 3000 as suggested inside your terminal.__ :+1:

Create React App references below;

```ruby__npm start__```
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

__npm test__
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

__npm run build__
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
__Your app is ready to be deployed!__

See the section about deployment for more information.

__npm run eject__
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
